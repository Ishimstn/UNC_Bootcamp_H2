                        <p>Hello my name is Ishmam Mustain. I am currently a senior at North Carolina State University, majoring in Nutrition Science. I am keenly interested in learning more about web applications and development, and curiosity led me to take the UNC Coding Bootcamp in order to hone my skills in coding and successfully land a software developer/engineering job. I enjoy ice skating, wrestling, and swimming as some of my personal hobbies. I also danced competitvely during my high school career and for almost 2 years throughout my college life as well.</p>

                    <p>My future goals in regards to my career for software development is to gain the necessary skills that I need to acquire to make myself employer ready and then move into becoming employer competitive by the end of this bootcamp. I am planning on learning C+ in Unreal Engines to create my own game and to showcase that as my project to build my resume. I am planning on looking for entry level positions in tech companies that reside in the Raleigh, Charlotte, and Greensboro regions of North Carolina </p>
